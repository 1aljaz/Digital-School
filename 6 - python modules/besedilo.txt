The Riemann zeta function or Euler–Riemann zeta function, denoted by the Greek letter ζ (zeta), is a mathematical function of a complex variable defined as ζ(s)=∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^s = 1/1^s + 1/2^s + 1/3^s + ⋯ for Re(s) > 1, and its analytic continuation elsewhere.[2] The Riemann zeta function plays a pivotal role in analytic number theory and has applications in physics, probability theory, and applied statistics. Leonhard Euler first introduced and studied the function over the reals in the first half of the eighteenth century. Bernhard Riemann's 1859 article "On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude" extended the Euler definition to a complex variable, proved its meromorphic continuation and functional equation, and established a relation between its zeros and the distribution of prime numbers. This paper also contained the Riemann hypothesis, a conjecture about the distribution of complex zeros of the Riemann zeta function that many mathematicians consider the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics.[3] The values of the Riemann zeta function at even positive integers were computed by Euler. The first of them, ζ(2), provides a solution to the Basel problem. In 1979 Roger Apéry proved the irrationality of ζ(3). The values at negative integer points, also found by Euler, are rational numbers and play an important role in the theory of modular forms. Many generalizations of the Riemann zeta function, such as Dirichlet series, Dirichlet L-functions and L-functions, are known.

Bernhard Riemann's article On the number of primes below a given magnitude
The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) is a function of a complex variable s = σ + it, where σ and t are real numbers. (The notation s, σ, and t is used traditionally in the study of the zeta function, following Riemann.) When Re(s) = σ > 1, the function can be written as a converging summation or as an integral: ζ(s)=∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^s = 1/Γ(s) ∫_0^∞ x^{s−1}/(e^x−1) dx, where Γ(s)=∫0^∞ x^{s−1} e^{−x} dx is the gamma function. The Riemann zeta function is defined for other complex values via analytic continuation of the function defined for σ > 1. Leonhard Euler considered the above series in 1740 for positive integer values of s, and later Chebyshev extended the definition to Re(s) > 1.[4] The above series is a prototypical Dirichlet series that converges absolutely to an analytic function for s such that σ > 1 and diverges for all other values of s. Riemann showed that the function defined by the series on the half-plane of convergence can be continued analytically to all complex values s ≠ 1. For s = 1, the series is the harmonic series which diverges to +∞, and lim{s→1}((s−1)ζ(s)) = 1. Thus the Riemann zeta function is a meromorphic function on the whole complex plane, which is holomorphic everywhere except for a simple pole at s = 1 with residue 1.
Euler's product formula
In 1737, the connection between the zeta function and prime numbers was discovered by Euler, who proved the identity ∑{n=1}^∞ 1/n^s = ∏{p\ prime} 1/(1−p^{−s}), where, by definition, the left-hand side is ζ(s) and the infinite product on the right-hand side extends over all prime numbers p (such expressions are called Euler products): ∏_{p\ prime} 1/(1−p^{−s}) = 1/(1−2^{−s}) ⋅ 1/(1−3^{−s}) ⋅ 1/(1−5^{−s}) ⋅ 1/(1−7^{−s}) ⋯. Both sides of the Euler product formula converge for Re(s) > 1. Since the harmonic series diverges at s = 1, the formula implies the infinitude of primes. It also implies that the sum of reciprocals of primes diverges.
The Euler product formula can also be used to compute the asymptotic probability that s randomly selected integers are coprime: ∏_{p\ prime}(1−1/p^s) = 1/ζ(s).
Riemann's functional equation
The zeta function satisfies the functional equation: ζ(s) = 2^s π^{s−1} sin(πs/2) Γ(1−s) ζ(1−s), an equality of meromorphic functions on the complex plane. This implies ζ(s) has trivial zeros at s = −2, −4, −6, … .
Riemann's xi function
Riemann defined ξ(s) = (s(s−1)/2) π^{−s/2} Γ(s/2) ζ(s), which satisfies ξ(s) = ξ(1−s).
Zeros, the critical line, and the Riemann hypothesis
The non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) lie in the critical strip 0 < Re(s) < 1 and are symmetric about Re(s)=1/2. The Riemann hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeros lie on the line Re(s)=1/2. It is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. More than 40% of non-trivial zeros have been proven to lie on the critical line, currently improved to 41.7%.
